    "\r\n",
    "-   **Field Technicians:** Perform work order tasks, inspections, and update asset data.\r\n",
    "-   **Inspectors:** Conduct planned and unplanned inspections, record findings, and update asset status directly from the field.\r\n",
    "-   **Storeroom Clerks:** Manage inventory, receive materials, and perform inventory inspections using the mobile application.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Typical Use Cases\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Common scenarios where Maximo Mobile is used:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "-   **Work Order Management:** Technicians manage work orders, update task status, and log labor and materials used directly on their mobile devices.\r\n",
    "-   **Inspection Execution:** Inspectors conduct inspections, record observations, and upload photos in real-time through the mobile app.\r\n",
    "-   **Inventory Management:** Storeroom clerks receive materials against purchase orders, perform inspections during receiving, and manage inventory levels using the mobile platform.\r\n",

    "### System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The system architecture of Maximo Mobile for Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) is designed to facilitate seamless integration and interaction between key components within Maximo Asset Management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The architecture diagram  typically illustrates the flow and relationship between mobile devices, Maximo Asset Management servers, and other intermediary components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/systemarchitecture.jpg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication and Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximo Mobile for EAM applications can operate in both online and offline scenarios, ensuring continuous functionality regardless of network connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When connected to Maximo Asset Management, the apps utilize available services and data in real-time.\n",
    "-   Data exchange occurs in JSON format.\n",
    "-   Requests from the mobile app are processed by an OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) service provider within Maximo Asset Management, which then returns the necessary response.\n",
    "-   Retrieved data is saved locally on the device for efficient access and continuity in case of disconnection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offline Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In offline mode, apps use locally stored data retrieved during previous online sessions.\n",
    "-   This ensures users can continue their tasks without interruption.\n",
    "-   Upon reconnection, local data is automatically synchronized with Maximo Asset Management to ensure data consistency.\n",
    "-   Users can also manually trigger data synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspections\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Enabled Mode:** When Maximo Mobile for EAM is enabled, inspections are conducted via the Maximo Mobile for EAM user interface.\n",
    "-   **Work Center:** Manage Inspection Forms are accessible on the Work Center.\n",
    "-   **Disabled Mode:** If Maximo Mobile for EAM is not enabled, all inspections are conducted directly on the Work Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online and Offline Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Mobile apps interact directly with Maximo Asset Management.\n",
    "-   Data is exchanged in JSON format and processed by OSLC service providers.\n",
    "-   Locally stored data on the device improves efficiency and allows work to continue during planned or unexpected disconnections.\n",
    "-   Synchronization of local data occurs automatically to maintain consistency, though manual synchronization is also possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offline Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Data operations are conducted using data stored locally from previous online sessions.\n",
    "-   Automatic synchronization resumes when connectivity is restored.\n",
    "-   Devices are considered offline under the following conditions:\n",
    "    -   Airplane mode is enabled.\n",
    "    -   Network adapter is disabled.\n",
    "    -   Network bandwidth is low.\n",
    "    -   Maximo Asset Management is not reachable.\n",

    "#### Initial Login\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Network Connectivity Required:** The first time a user logs into the Maximo Mobile application, they need network connectivity to connect to Maximo Asset Management.\n",
    "-   **Credentials:** Users must enter their Maximo Asset Management credentials.\n",
    "-   **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Once the user logs in, they are authenticated with Maximo Asset Management via SSO, and the mobile apps on the Maximo Asset Management server are set up on the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Local Data Store Creation:** During the initial setup, a local JSON data store is created on the device. This store is a repository for data downloaded from Maximo Asset Management.\n",
    "-   **Encryption:** The local data store is encrypted with a unique key saved in the device's keystore.\n",
    "-   **Security Prompt:** Each time the user opens the Maximo Mobile for EAM app, they are prompted for their device's security credentials to access the local data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authentication Token\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Token Granting:** Upon authentication to Maximo Asset Management, the user receives a token.\n",
    "-   **Token Duration:** The token is valid for 12 hours.\n",
    "-   **Re-authentication:** After 12 hours, the user must re-authenticate. If they fail to authenticate, they can continue working offline until successful re-authentication.\n",
    "-   **Manual Authentication:** Users can manually authenticate at any time by clicking the cloud icon on the application screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biometric Login\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Biometric Access:** Users can use biometric methods (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition) to log in to the device.\n",
    "-   **Access to Local Database:** If authenticated through SSO, users can access their own local database for offline mode.\n",
    "-   **Multiple Users on One Device:**\n",
    "    -   If a second user logs in using biometrics but does not authenticate with the server, they will access the local database of the last user who authenticated online.\n",
    "    -   In offline mode, the second user accesses the first user's local database.\n",
    "    -   In online mode, the second user is prompted to switch users. If they confirm, they can access their own local database; if not, they continue to use the last user's local database offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Switching\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Offline Access:** If a second user accesses the app offline without server authentication, they use the previous user's local database.\n",
    "-   **Online Mode Prompt:** Upon going online, the second user receives a popup to switch users. Confirming the switch loads the current user's local database."

    "    -   Role-based applications utilize object structures from Maximo Asset Management.\n",
    "    -   These applications exchange data using OSLC/REST calls.\n",
    "    -   Access levels to object structures are defined in the Object Structure tab of the Maximo Asset Management Security Groups application.\n",
